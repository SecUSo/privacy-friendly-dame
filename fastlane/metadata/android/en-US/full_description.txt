How does Privacy Friendly Checkers differ from other similar apps?

1) No permissions

Privacy Friendly Dame does not require any permissions.

2) No advertisement

Moreover, Privacy Friendly Dame completely relinquishes advertisement. Many other apps in the Google Play Store display advertisement and therefore might violate the users privacy, shorten battery life or use mobile data.

Privacy Friendly Checkers is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsuhe Institute of Technology. More information at: https://secuso.org/pfa
